# AXON-Automobile-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard-POWER-BI-

Axon Automobile, a small retailer was facing challenges managing and understanding their sales data. The sales team had a hard time making sense of the information, and the management couldn't get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which made it tough to make important decisions.
To fix this problem, Axon decided to use Microsoft Power BI and SQL to create a Business Intelligence (BI) tool. Our goal was to help them manage and analyze their sales data in a better way.

How we did it:
We started by getting the sales, product, order, customer, and payment details from their database using SQL. Then, we analyzed the data to figure out what's important and how we can use it to help the company.
Next, the SQL database was connected to Power BI via a connector, and data was transformed using Power Query to ensure seamless synchronization of visualizations. We focused on data modeling to establish relationships among essential data points for a cohesive and insightful analysis. Leveraging DAX and Power BI's quick measure feature, we created key measures to compare results and track performance trends over time.
The final result is a user-friendly dashboard that offers valuable insights into sales, customer profiles, order details, payments, and employee performance based on sales. 
ï»¿To enhance user experience, we introduced tooltips that provide a more efficient understanding of the data. We also incorporated a minimal view that displays essential details and insights upon hovering over specific elements.

Key Tools Used:
SQL: To get and manage the sales data.
Power BI: To visualize and analyze the data in a better way.
